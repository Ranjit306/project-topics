    <h2>Technology Stack:</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>
            <pre>
        💻 Frontend: React.js / Angular / Vue.js
        For a dynamic and responsive user interface, React.js or Angular provides fast rendering and seamless user experiences.
                
        🗄️ Backend: Node.js (Express) / Python (Django or Flask)
        Node.js is ideal for handling multiple requests efficiently, while Django or Flask can be used for a more structured backend, especially if integrating with AI features or more complex logic.
                
        📦 Database: MySQL / MongoDB
        MySQL is a solid choice for relational data like student and teacher records, grades, and schedules. MongoDB may be used for handling non-relational data or when scalability is a key concern.
                
        💰 Payment Integration: Razorpay / Stripe / PayPal  
        Secure online fee payment integration, supporting various payment methods such as UPI, debit/credit cards, and wallets.
                
        📊 Data Analytics: Google Analytics / Custom Analytics Dashboard
        To provide administrators with insights into system usage, student performance trends, and attendance patterns.
